### Mission

To invite others to experience with me the fullness of a life led by God

### About me

I'm currently studying at Duke in North Carolina. You can reach me by email at joshua@petit.dev
or by instagram [@josh.petitma](https://www.instagram.com/josh.petitma/)

I work on an app called [Bible Ram](https://bibleram.app) that helps people
memorize the bible. Comitting scripture to memory has changed my life and will
change yours too.
