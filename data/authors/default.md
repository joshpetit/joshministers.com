## Mission

I want to help people grow towards relationship
with Christ that will make them **enjoy** life, **hope** for the future,
and want to do something **amazing** every day!

I believe a relationship with Jesus is the foolproof way to not only get meaning
out of your life but a level of enjoyment that cannot be matched.

## About me

I'm currently a student at Duke and help run a campus ministry called
[trianglesda](https://trianglesda.org). This ministry is for anyone in the
Raleigh area that's a college aged student, funded by the Adventist churches in
the area.
