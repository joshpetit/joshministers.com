# Why believe the Bible

So the first set of studies we'll be having is a bit meta. Before we go in and
understand the fundamentals of the Bible, we should take a look and see what
reason there is in the first place to believe in the Bible. What's its
importance and why is it relevant for our lives?

I first want to open it up for discussion, let's split off into groups of 3 and
see what each others thoughts are. If you were to argue for the Bible, what
reasons would you give for its relevance today?

Why should we believe the Bible

- The way it changed the present
- The way it predicted the future
- The miracle it had in the past

## The way it predicted the future

A reason we can believe the Bible is also because of its prophetic nature.

For example. The book of Mark was written sometime between 55-60 AD. There's a
whole category of research that talks about seeing when the gospels were written
that we won't get into.

So in chapter 13 of mark it details an interesting history

**[Mark 13:1-2 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=Mark+13:1-2)**

1 As He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, “Teacher,
behold what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!” 2 And Jesus said to
him, "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left upon another
which will not be torn down"

Here, Jesus is talking about the temple in Jerusalem. This was a prophecy he
made regarding its destruction. Jesus likely said these things around 30 AD, it
was recorded down around 55-60AD, and then about 10 years after its recording in
70AD the romans ransacked Jerusalem and destroyed their temple. Just as Jesus
had prophesied.

This is just one example of prophecies in the Bible.

In the old testament we're also filled with prophecies that predict Jesus'
coming.
If we flip to **[ Isaiah 53:1-5 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=+Isaiah+53:1-5)**

> Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? 2 For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant, And as a root out of dry ground. He has no form or comeliness; And when we see Him, There is no beauty that we should desire Him. 3 He is despised and rejected by men, A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.
>
> 4 Surely He has borne our griefs And carried our sorrows; Yet we esteemed Him stricken, Smitten by God, and afflicted. 5 But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed.

We can read about the "Sufering servant." The earliest manuscripts of Isaiah
date at least 200 years before Jesus' birth and details to the tee the plan of
salvation God had in Jesus' crucifixtion.

A statician tried to calculate the probability that Jesus would fulfill as He
did all the prophecies we see about Him in the old testament and it came out to
a likelihood of one a many many trillions.

The Jews at the time were not looking for a messiah figure like Jesus. They
wanted someone to liberate them from the Romans and restore the kingdom of
Israel to its former glory. The fact that Jews stuck with Him and the gospel
exploded as it did points to the prophecies of the past coming to fulfillment in
Christ.

Not only that, there is actually a Bible prophecy that details the birth of
Christ as well found in the book of Daniel. It's called the 70 week prophecy, I
won't go into it today, but when looking at the historical context for the
kingdom at the time it gives an exact year for the coming Christ. I'd recommend
searching up Mark Finley's explanation of the 70 week prophecy as well as other
online sources.

**[2 Peter 1:21 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=2+Peter+1:21)**

> for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.

And this all lends credibility to how the Bible is from God. And if the Bible is
from God, we ought to take a look at the claims that it made.

## The way it changed the present

**[2 Timothy 3:16-17 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=2+Timothy+3:16-17)**

> 16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.

This scripture is the idea that the Bible is an inspired book, and everything
within this book is useful for growing into the kinds of humans the Bible claims
God designed us to be.

And with that, the teachings in this book were antithetical to what the people
in almost all contexts of the Bible believed. Later, we'll talk about the
division between the old and new testament and the Bible's development.

### Monotheism

For example, the Bible was written with the idea that there was only one
God. This was the opposite of what many people believed in the anciet near
east and Roman territory.

Christians in the early church were actually called athiests because htey
believed in one God and disbelieved all others. People at the itme found the
idea of there not being a god of the mountain or a god of the sea deeply
offensive. It was so offensive that Christianity for a long time was called
"religio illicite" which means banned religion and they were persecuted for this
strong belief.

### Humility

The concept of humility on top of that was deemed as very strange. When these
Christians were being persecuted, they would have stories about willingly giving
themselves over. Rome was built on the idea of glory and dominance, so seeing
the Christian church do lowly things such as inviting slaves to their feasts, or
giving equality to one another was also found strange.

**[Phillippians 2:3 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=Phillippians+2:3)**

> 3 Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.

### Embarassement

And to climax it all, the central person in the Bible, the person who the whole
religion professes to follow, was clothed in humility. He wasn't born in a
palance, like many other deities in other religions. He didn't have great
wealth, nor vast kingdoms or huge military victories.

It's not only that, but many of the most important figures in the Bible were
revealed to be flawed as well. From David, to Moses, to one of the most
important figures in the early church Peter who was shown to struggle in his
faith in Jesus, to many other people that show embrassing human flaws.

Most people who are making up a religion or want to create a religion to coerce
people, would choose the central person in that religion to be someone of high
repute. Not someone like Jesus who came with a message and ultimately died a
humiliating death for this message.

**[Hebrews 12:2 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=Hebrews+12:2)**

> 2 looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

This message that he spread was a message founded on love. And a love of a form
not commonly spoken of.

### Love

The Bible speaks about giving unconditonal love to those around us and to
God. Jesus, the central figure in the Bible, emphasized the idea of looking to
obey the underlying law of love. He came saying that God so loved the world that
He gave Himself that no one should perish (**[John 3:16 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=John+3:16)**).

And not only that, He came saying that everyone needed to repent, to reorient
themselves toward God in this new vision of love. This was a radical message for
the people at the time.

He came with a message that was filled with love and at the same time hard to
accept since it required a radical transformation of life. A message that was
both different and difficult.

### Put it together

Okay, so here we have a case against Christianity. It's

- Monotheisit
- Drenched in humility
- Embarrassing
- It focuses on love and surrender

And guess what. This religion that was severely persecuted, that started in a
small town in the middle of nowhere, exploded.

It grew despite the persecution, And now today we have half the world professing
to follow the Bible. This religion, that was so small and seemingly
insignificant has changed the world so much that we deliminate time by the
central figure's bith and deaht (b.c meaning before Christ) and A.D meaning in
the day of our Lord.

Discussion: How could Christianity and the Bible it followed grow so explosively
despite all of these things that went against it?

Thoughts:

The Bible is either the largest hoax in human history that was able to resonate
with people in innumerable contexts over the course of thousands of years

_Or_ the Bible is from God and speaks on how we as humans ought to live as He has
designed us.

**[2 Timothy 3:16-17 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=2+Timothy+3:16-17)**

> 16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. re

## The miracle it had in the past

And the last, and the most central, reason on why we should believe the Bible
is the miracle that happened in the past: the ressurection of Jesus.

The whole of Christianity hinges on this one thing: was Jesus raised from the
dead or not? If He claimed to be the son of God, prophecied that He would die
and ressurect and then go on to do just that, His claims on the Bible's
authority is enough for us to believe in the Bible.

So then a good question is, how do we know if He was resurrected from the dead?

The first thing is that we can know that He was a real person. Christ is an
historic, which means the vast majority of scholars believe that He was a real
person that walked on earth. This is backed up by the multiple accounts we have
of his life that happened so soon after the time that he walke don the
earth. Accounts were written roughly thirty years after his death. This short
span gives no time for a legend to form. The accounts list specific people who
would have been alive at the time of the writing to cooberate the testimonies of
the witnesses. If they wanted to make a legend, they would have written about
someone who lived 200 years before, at a distance where no one could fact check
their claims.

## Conclude

These are just three points that we've gone over on why the Bible ought to be
believed.

- The way that it predicted the future
- The way it changed the present against all odds
- And the miracle that it had in the past

Another, very important, reason to believe the Bible is the transofmation in can
do within you.

The Bible doesn't just claim to be a history book. It claims to be a love letter
from God to you on how to live in this broken world and overcome it through
Him. When we open it up and read its pages it reads us and has councel and
wisdom that we won't be able to fully uncover even after a lifetime or eternity
of reading.

The largest testimony to the credibility of the Bible to you personally is your
testimony.

People on your campus will be bolstered by knowing what are some of the factual,
tangible reasons we can believe in the Bible. But people will never come to know
Christ unless they make the step to experience Christ. And your own experience
is an invitation for them to taste and see that the Lord is good.

**[Revelation 21:4 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=Revelation+21:4)** says

> And they overcame him (Satan) by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their
> testimony.

That tesimony that God gives you, it's a powerful weapon. So let's go forth on
our campuses knowing that we haven't just believed cleverly devised fables, but
that we have experience the real God and that others can experience Him too by
embracing the love and truth in this book.
