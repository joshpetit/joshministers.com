> **Tèt Vid**

My mom would call me this often, sometimes multiple times a day. It's the
Haitian Creole term for "someone that forgets easily" and translates to "having
an empty head."

Whenever my mom asked me to do a task (e.g. grab some water, close the blinds) I
would run down the stairs, bent on completing the task. Before I hit the bottom
step, however, my mind would have already been turned off, completely oblivious
to why I came down the stairs. Maybe my head was not so empty, but more
too easily filled with diversions. Sometimes it would be the distracting way the
lightbulb flickered or the sound made when I stepped on a particular stair:
something would catch my attention, destroy my focus, and force me to run back
to my mom and ask her what she had asked me to do.

> **Tèt Vid!**

To this day I find myself repeating _tèt vid_ to myself over and over again. I
find the distraction is now no longer the buzzing fly, but the near-constant
parade of responsibilities cycling around my mind. The beautiful paintings on
our stairway walls that once stole my attention have been replaced by
aspirations held so dearly that I often forget to eat in pursuit of them. How
can my head be so empty yet so full?

Distractions are the prime way to keep us from accomplishing what we originally
set out to do when we first encountered Christ. God is clear in the Bible on a
few things He would like every Christian to be doing: growing closer to Him
(**[Matthew 11:27-28 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=Matthew+11:27-28)**) and bringing Him to others (**[Matthew 28:18-20 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=Matthew+28:18-20)**) are
notable examples.

We soon find that life throws so many opportunities at us that we struggle to
choose what to participate in. We would feel foolish _not_ to say "Yes!" to
every offer. Progressively, we find our responsibilities compounding, our minds
further occupied with more and more of our wants and aspirations, and conversely
less and less of God's mission for our lives.

Many of the distractions are admirable: starting a business, spending more time
on a passion project, or maybe learning guitar. For many of us, it is our
natural tendency to want to do everything.

In "The Good News of Our Limits"<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Sean McGever discusses how we as humans often
take verses such as "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"
(**[Phillippians 4:13 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=Phillippians+4:13)**) and use them as an excuse to push past the limits God
designed for us as humans. Taking this a step further, we use verses like this
to justify doing everything we _want_ to do no matter the danger it can put our
spiritual lives in. The truth is that we _can't_ possibly do everything. There
simply are not enough hours in the day nor energy in our bodies to tackle all
the responsibilities and hobbies that we could possibly take on. God did not
design us to be able to do everything, so when we try to go past our physical,
emotional, and mental limits we find ourselves lagging in some areas and often
our spiritual lives.

A common way we try to rationalize these seasons of distraction is by saying we
desire to "bring glory to God through our hard work and success." But the truth
is that

> **God is more interested in you being His child than you being successful**

God does not want us to compromise His will to do what we find great in our
eyes. **[Matthew 23:23 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=Matthew+23:23)** describes Jesus' frustration over the Pharisees
honoring God in one area of their lives but completely neglecting Him in
others. We should shift our main desires from doing just what we find honorable
to being where God has called us to be: growing closer to Him and bringing Him
to others (among other things we may feel a calling towards).

The solution to having tèt vid moments is well known in most cases: discipline
and moderation (**[1 Corinthians 6:12 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=1+Corinthians+6:12)**, **[1 Corinthians 9:25 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=1+Corinthians+9:25)**). Many of the
things we find ourselves occupied with are not harmful in and of themselves but
need to be moderated to allow for more time for our God-given goals. Finding
ways to moderate how much time we spend on individual responsibilities as well
as disciplining ourselves to keep to that will help us shift our priorities back
to that which God set us out to do in the first place. This may look like
spending one less hour practicing your guitar so you can read your bible, waking
up earlier to complete an assignment so you can help lead out a bible study, or
even leaving a club you enjoy to better manage your time with
God. It is better to hold on to less responsibility and have peace knowing you
are in the center of God's will than to hold onto more with "anxious striving"
(**[Ecclesiastes 4:6 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/bible?language=en&version=NKJV&passage=Ecclesiastes+4:6)**).

Although prioritizing our mission from God may require difficult sacrifices, we
can do so with **joy** knowing that God did _more_ for us. Christ chose to
prioritize our lives above His own. He chose to sacrifice the comforts of heaven
and participate in our pains so that we could get the chance to one day live
with Him. It's in the face of this Love we choose to forego some opportunities
or moderate time spent on hobbies so that we can better serve His goal in our
lives.

Where have you seen the distractions of life taking away from your relationship
with God? Where have your aspirations put you in a position where you're finding
little time every day to speak to God let alone tell others about His love for
them? Christ sent you on a task and if you're now realizing that you have
forgotten it, run back to Him and reassess how you are spending your life. The
sooner we admit we've been living our lives with "tèt vid" the sooner He can
send us back out on His mission.
